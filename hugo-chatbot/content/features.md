## why?

Why don't I just use the official CKEditor?

CKEditor versionn 3 does not natively support iOS devices as of 2012. Depending on the project's requirements, the official CKEditor might be too heavy or not performant enough. Users might seek lighter alternatives that offer faster load times and better responsiveness.

That's why you would choose to use this app.
