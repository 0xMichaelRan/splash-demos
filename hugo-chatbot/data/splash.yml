# these buttons represent links that will be shown under the title
# they represent quick actions you want your user to take, like Install or
# Discover features
#
# Each button has different properties:
# - title is a string, will be shown as the button text
# - link is the url to which the button should navigate the user to
# - color can be one of the following: blue, red, orange, yellow, green,
#   purple (default is blue)
# - outline activates an alternative style with which the button has a
#   transparent background and colored outline
# - squared activates an alternative style with which the button has no border
#   radius. this makes for a more serious and less playful appearance
# the only mandatory properties are title and link
